This repo hosts the code for a collobration project between Dr. Missy Wong's group and Dr. Guanming Wu's group at OHSU for analyzing BMI1+ intestinal stem cells during development, homeostasis and damage repair.

Raw 10x counts and FASTA files can be found on GEO (#XXXX) and SRA (#XXXX). 10X matrices should be deposited in the `raw` directory.

The resources folder contains static files to help with reproducing the results where some variability is always observed like CytoTRACE results and UMAP coordinates. DEG lists and Reactome pathway-gene sets are also present as well as the exported conda environment used for generating the results in this manuscript.

Python and R scripts are in their respective folders and should output results within their directories. 

TODO: Will add procedure for re-creating environment.
